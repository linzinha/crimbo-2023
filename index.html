                    <p>
                        It's easy! Just message me in game or in Discord and I will confirm when I add you to the players list

                    <h2>How it works</h2>
                    <p>
                        Each day I will randomize an item and a player and give a gift to that player. NOTE: the item drawn may be a REPRESENTATION of the prize, but it will always be of greater value in that case. For example if you land on an IOTM I won't give you a consumable from said item. But if you land on a consumable it may be part of a pack of items.

                    <h2>Can I contribute?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sure! You can either send me items to add to my Display Case (the official prize vault), OR if you prefer to do so for high value items you can promuise to deliver the item to the winner. In that case I will list your ingame name next to the item to ID you as the owner of the prize.
                    </p>
                    <p>Currently the prizes are based on what I can afford so if anyone wants to donate they can (no pressure) and the prizes will get better. If people choose to donate I will start a page with a list of donors and ow their donations were used.</p>
