                    To go along with Crimbo, I have decided to do a very simple giveaway. One prize per person per day. 
                    The prize and person are both pulled from their respective queues.

                    <h2>FAQ</h2>
                    <h3>How can I play?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The easiest, best method is this form below. If it's not working or you're really not comfortable, 
                        you can kmail me but this is the best way to make sure you're included.
                    </p>
                    <h3>I got an error submitting my player name</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you get an error, doublecheck that your name isn't already on the list. If it's not, kmail me!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Where's my name?</h3>
                    <p>
                        It could be a number of reasons, actually.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>This data is updated manually</strong> to make the page load more quickly: If you want 
                                to see realtime data to verify that your name was added, you can <a href="https://kol.linzinha.is/players"> 
                                check the storage endpoint here</a>, but note that it can take a good 8 seconds to load
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>The content is cached in your browser</strong>: try an incognito window</li>
                            <li><strong>You entered your name beginning with a lowercase letter</strong>: Check after all the uppercase names</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each day I will randomize the winner of the day, and then the prize for the next day in /games. The timing has varied wildly
                         and will continue to do so because I lack consistency, BUT it is between 7 and 9pm UTC most of the time.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Oh no my prize sucks!</h3>
                    <p>
                        It may secretly be amazing! The item drawn may be a REPRESENTATION of what you've won, but the actual prize will always
                        be of equal or greater value than the item drawn.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Do I have to reenter every day?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Nope! If I do a call for entries, its just to get new/more people to join in the fun
                    </p>
                    <h3>Can I contribute?</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you like! However contributions are neither expected nor required. You can either send me items to add to my Display Case 
                        (the official prize vault), OR if you prefer to do so for high value items you can promise to deliver the item to the winner 
                        yourself. In that case I will list your ingame name next to the item to ID you as the owner of the prize.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Send me a kmail with your contribution or the name of the item you want me to list if you're holding onto it
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Please tell me exactly what you want me to do with any items sent! For example:
                                <li>
                                    Do you want me to list you anonymously?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Are you donating an item to be auctioned?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Is it a financial contribution to improve the prize pool?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Is it something else?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If the item isn't drawn, do you want it back?
                                </li>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>What are you going to do with undrawn items</h3>
                    <p>
                        Right now, unless someone explicitly tells me to keep something I am going to either keep drawing until the pot is empty, 
                        give donations back, or both. Right now I am strongly leaning toward a lightning game of ARs in /games on the final day until
                        everything is won.
